# Problem Solving Traning
#### This task is for IEEE BAU Computer Society candidates .
#### the task is divided to two parts .


## Part 1:
#### You have to solve the following problems by using c++/c Programming language.

### Problem 1:

#### Given a non-negative int n ,write a program that prints the sum of it's digits
```
example:
sumDigits(126) → 9
sumDigits(49) → 13
sumDigits(12) → 3
```

### Problem 2:

#### write a program that checks if a given number is a power of 2

```
example:
PowerOfTwo(8) -> true
PowerOfTwo(9) -> false
```
